        <h2>Why Time Zones Were Invented</h2>
        <p>Before the 19th century, towns set their clocks based on the sunâ€™s position, leading to small but significant time differences between nearby locations. With the rise of railroads and telegraphs, the need for a standardized time system became evident. In 1884, the International Meridian Conference established the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as the global standard, dividing the world into 24 time zones. This system enabled better coordination for travel, trade, and communication across long distances. Today, time zones remain essential for global connectivity, though daylight saving time and regional variations can still cause confusion.</p>
        <h2>The Impact of Daylight Saving Time on Productivity</h2>
        <p>Daylight Saving Time (DST) was introduced to make better use of daylight and save energy. However, its impact on productivity is debated. Some studies suggest that the time shift disrupts sleep patterns, leading to a temporary decline in focus and efficiency. For instance, the Monday after DST begins often sees an increase in workplace accidents and errors. On the other hand, proponents argue that longer daylight hours in the evening encourage outdoor activities and reduce energy costs. Countries like Japan and South Korea have opted out of DST, while others continue to evaluate its benefits and drawbacks.</p>
